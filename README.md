# Day-Planner

This is a simple work day planner. This planner is based on a 9-5 workday. Languages used are:
-HTML

Moment.js was used to get the current time and date and displayed onto the HTML page. 

### Usage
-On each hour you can type in your acitivity under the activity column. Hit the save button to save the text in local storage. When the page is refreshed or the browser is closed, the saved text will still be displayed. To clear the texts, there is a clear all text button below the table.

-The color of the rows will change throughout the day, depending on the hour. The activity row will be highlighted in red on the current hour. The hours that past will be hightlighted in gray and the future hours will be highlighted in green.
